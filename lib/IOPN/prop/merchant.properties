# Merchant's shared aws secret key
# format when multiple access keys are present : AWSSecretKeyList=(awsAccessKeyId1,awsSecretAccessKey1),(awsAccessKeyId2,awsSecretAccessKey2)
# format when a single access key is present   : AWSSecretKeyList=(awsAccessKeyId1,awsSecretAccessKey1)
#
# In the class CBAIOPNProcessor.php, the LoadAWSAccessKeys() method has been written such a way that it looks for merchant.properties file
# as the source for the AWSSecretKeyList and it parses this list assuming that it follows the above mentioned format. If merchant wants to change
# either the source or the format or both, of the AWSAccessKeyList then he should change the logic present in the LoadAWSAccessKeys() method.
